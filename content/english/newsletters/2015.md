Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries has had a successful year with many highlights such as providing dinner every Tuesday for every student who attends KBC, sending over 100 KBC students to Camp Grace for spectacular week-long summer camps, and gifting over 400 kids during their Christmas outreach and Happy Birthday Jesus party. They believe that God always works through a team of people committed to Him and His ministry.
