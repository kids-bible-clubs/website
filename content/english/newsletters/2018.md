Kid’s Bible Clubs Ministries moved to their new location of New Victoria Baptist Church but with the same assignment as always described in their mission statement- “Believing we have eternal hope through Jesus Christ, the mission of Kid’s Bible Clubs Ministries is to seek out lost children who do not attend church or live in Christian homes and provide them with a Christ-centered, spiritual foundation where they can hear the gospel, come to Jesus and grow in Him.” They depend on His power to put them on top of their game, being salt and light to those around them.
