Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries had a busy year in 2012 with many opportunities to share the love and story of Jesus Christ with children and youth. They were able to provide many events where the kids could learn and grow in their faith in Jesus including 3 weeks of Vacation Bible School, 5 camp opportunities, not to mention Bible, school supply and Christmas gift distribution! None of this would be possible without consistency in prayer and generous giving.
