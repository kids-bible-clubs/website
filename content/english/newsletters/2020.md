Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries focused on benevolence and meeting the numerous needs of many of their families during the pandemic. They delivered groceries every Saturday morning and transported families to locations offering services such as school supplies. They also purchased food, clothing and supplies as God miraculously brought in KBC donations to do so.
