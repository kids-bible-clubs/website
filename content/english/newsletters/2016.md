Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries aims to provide a Bible study program and raise money for kids in their community who do not experience going to church on a regular basis, nor Christian Camp, VBS or a host of opportunities kids from churchgoing families can take advantage of. They believe that the best help anyone in this world can receive is the good news of how to begin a relationship with God through the Holy Spirit, because of the finished work of Jesus Christ.
