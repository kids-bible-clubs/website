Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries is grateful for their supporters who have enabled them to further enhance their outreach by hosting their kids at their Vacation Bible Schools, serving as guest speakers and music leaders at their worship services, providing Christmas gifts for the kids and sharing space for their programs and fundraisers to keep them afloat. Caring Christian ministries fed their kids and their families nutritious meals and furnished clothing and school supplies.
