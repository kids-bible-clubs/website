Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries saw over 250 kids walk through their doors at their weekly gathering in 2019. They transported and provided lunches for 100 to attend a week of VBS at First Baptist Canton and sponsored 52 to a top-notch week of Christian camp at Camp Grace. Over 30 made decisions to turn to Christ and they were blessed to baptize 7.
