Kidâ€™s Bible Clubs Ministries is grateful for their donors and prayer partners who played a vital role in their successful year. They believe that all children matter to Jesus and need to hear the gospel, not just those who are taken to church with their families. They also believe that being pro-life is preventing abortion but goes much further and seeking out kids in the community to lay the foundation is the next step.
