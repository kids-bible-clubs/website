#### Exciting Camp Opportunity for KBC Kids!

<img src="/website/images/summercamp.webp">

Just as KBC exists to provide opportunities for spiritual growth specifically to un-churched and at-risk kids, **Camp Grace** is a ministry solely dedicated to serving the under-served, inner-city, and impoverished youth in Georgia with a high-quality Christian camp. Sounds like a match made in heaven, right?


- We raise $125 per camper who wants to go.
- Parents pay what they can but most of our kids are from low-income families so they usually cannot afford much if anything.
- Please help if you can and know any amount you are led and able to give will be appreciated and invested in kids being loved and cared for as Jesus would.

You can donate into our camp fund; please consider a generous gift!!! Click the ‘Donate’ button on the left and contribute via check, credit card, debit card or PayPal account. Or mail in a donation to our PO Box listed just below the donate buttons on our home page.

**More About Camp Grace**: The camp facility spans 268 acres which includes 3 lakes, a gigantic gymnasium, a junior Olympic sized swimming pool, horses, sports fields, climbing walls, a beautiful amphitheater, a brand new 25,000 sq foot dining hall and a western village. Some of the activities are:

- High and low ropes as well as zip lines for all levels
- Swimming, wet zip lines and water sports
- Basketball, soccer, archery and other sports
- Fishing
- Horseback riding
- Multilevel rock climbing
- Dance, music, drama, art and other elective classes

**All activities are centered around sharing the love and truth of Jesus Christ through Amazing Bible Study, Live Worship, and CrossTalk where the gospel is shared through a live drama presentation focusing on the crucifixion and an illustrated sermon.**
